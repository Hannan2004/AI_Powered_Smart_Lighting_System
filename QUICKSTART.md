Navigate to: **http://localhost:4000/enhanced-demo**

You should see:
- ✅ A beautiful dark-themed dashboard
- ✅ Live map with 600+ street lights
- ✅ Stats bar showing system metrics
- ✅ Advanced simulation scenarios panel

### **Step 3: Run Your First Simulation**

1. Scroll to the right panel
2. Click **"Launch Scenario"** on **"Cascading Power Failure"**
3. Watch the magic happen:
   - Progress bar animates
   - Lights change status on the map
   - Agent activity feed updates
   - Incidents appear with radius circles
   - Toast notifications show events

---

## 🎬 What to Try

### **Explore the Map:**
- **Zoom in/out** to see all 600+ street lights
- **Click any light** to see full telemetry (voltage, current, brightness, etc.)
- **Click a zone** to select it
- **Watch incidents** with animated radius circles

### **Run All 3 Scenarios:**

1. **Cascading Power Failure** (HARD) - 45 seconds
   - See how one transformer failure cascades across zones
   - Watch emergency power routing in action

2. **Coordinated Cyber Attack** (EXTREME) - 50 seconds
   - Malware spreads through the network mesh
   - AI-powered threat detection and response

3. **Hurricane Multi-System** (EXTREME) - 60 seconds
   - Weather, power, and security systems coordinate
   - Pre-storm protocols and emergency response

### **Monitor Real-Time Stats:**
- **Top Stats Bar:** See lights online/offline, power load, incidents
- **System Health:** Progress bars showing uptime and capacity
- **Agent Activity Feed:** Live updates from all agents
- **WebSocket Status:** Green badge when streaming is active

## 📊 What You're Seeing

### **The Map Shows:**
- **Green lights:** Online and operational
- **Red lights:** Offline or failed
- **Yellow lights:** Warning state
- **Amber lights:** Under maintenance
- **Incident markers:** Active events (cyber, power, weather)
- **Zone polygons:** Color-coded by status

### **The Dashboard Shows:**
- **600+ Street Lights** across 12 zones
- **Real-time telemetry** for each light
- **Power grid topology** with substations
- **Cascading failures** simulation
- **Multi-agent coordination**

---

## 🎮 Interactive Features

### **Click Actions:**
- **Street Light:** View detailed telemetry popup
- **Zone:** Select zone and see zone info
- **Incident Marker:** View incident details
- **Launch Scenario:** Start simulation
- **Stop Button:** Stop running simulation

### **Real-Time Updates:**
- Lights change color when status changes
- Stats bar updates every second
- Agent activity feed shows live actions
- Progress bar tracks scenario execution

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Map Not Loading?**
- Wait a few seconds - generating 600 lights takes time
- Refresh the page
- Check console for errors

### **Simulations Not Working?**
- Make sure backend services are running (optional for demo)
- The demo works standalone with simulated data
- Check browser console for API errors

### **Performance Issues?**
- Zoom in to reduce visible markers
- Enable "Show all lights" toggle to control visibility
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The dashboard is optimized for:
- **Desktop:** Full experience with all panels
- **Tablet:** Stacked layout
- **Mobile:** Vertical scroll layout
