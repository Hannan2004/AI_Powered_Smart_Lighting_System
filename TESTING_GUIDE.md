## üìä Verify Real Data

### **Check Dashboard Metrics**

**Active Agents:**
- Should show 5+ (Weather agents: collection, sensor, impact, disaster, reporting)
- Number changes based on agent states

**Active Alerts:**
- Initially 0
- Increases when simulations trigger alerts

**System Uptime:**
- Should show ~99% or calculated from backend

### **Check Weather Data**

Navigate to any dashboard and check **LiveClockAndWeather** component:
- Temperature should show real value (not "--")
- Weather condition should be descriptive (not "---")
- Humidity percentage should be realistic
- Weather icon matches condition (sun, cloud, rain)

---

## üé® Verify UI/UX

### **Loading States**
- Buttons show spinner during API calls
- Buttons are disabled during execution
- Metrics cards show pulse animation while loading

### **Toast Notifications**
- Appear in top-right corner
- Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
- Show loading ‚Üí success/error sequence
- Smooth slide-in animation

### **Activity Feed**
- Smooth fade-in animation for new items
- Color-coded by status (blue, green, red)
- Scrollable if more than 10 items
- Timestamps accurate

### **Hover Effects**
- Metric cards - border lights up on hover
- Buttons - color darkens on hover
- Service cards - subtle shadow increase

---

## üîç Debugging

### **Backend Not Responding**
```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f weather-agent
docker-compose logs -f power-agent
docker-compose logs -f cybersecurity-agent

# Restart all services
docker-compose restart
```

### **Frontend Errors**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Look for CORS errors or 404s

### **Data Not Updating**
1. Check auto-refresh is enabled (default: 5 seconds)
2. Click manual "Refresh" button
3. Verify backend /health endpoints:
   - http://localhost:8001/health
   - http://localhost:8002/health
   - http://localhost:8000/health
